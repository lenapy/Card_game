Blackjack
Rules:
The player or players are dealt a two-card hand and add together the
value of their cards. Face cards (kings, queens, and jacks) are counted
as ten points. A player and the dealer can count an ace as 1 point or 11
points. All other cards are counted as the numeric value shown
on the card. After receiving their first two cards, players have
the option of getting a "hit", or taking an additional card.
In a given round, the player or the dealer wins by having a score of 21
or by having the higher score that is less than 21. Scoring higher
than 21 (called "busting" or "going bust") results in a loss.
A player may win by having any final score equal to or less
than 21 if the dealer busts. If a player holds an ace valued as 11,
the hand is called "soft", meaning that the player cannot go bust by
taking an additional card; 11 plus the value of any other card will
always be less than or equal to 21. Otherwise, the hand is "hard".

The dealer must hit until the cards total 17 or more points.
(At many tables the dealer also hits on a "soft" 17, i.e.
a hand containing an ace and one or more other cards totaling six.)
Players win by not busting and having a total higher than the dealer's.
The dealer loses by busting or having a lesser hand than the player
who has not busted. If the player and dealer have the same total, this
is called a "push", and the player typically does not win or lose money
on that hand. If all available players bust, the hand ends automatically
without the dealer having to play his or her hand.
